        <div id="infopig" class="reading-info">I wrote this based on a prompt I found on Substack. I forgot what the prompt was, but I meant the story as an allegory for immigration. I don't think it really worked like that, but hopefully it can find a new life as a bedtime story.</div>

        <div id="infodescribe" class="reading-info">I wasn't sure of whether to classify this as a story or as a poem. I feel like it's somewhere in between. I serendipitously came across it a very long time ago, I think when I was still in high school. I thought it was beautiful without being saccharine. Every now and then I go back to it, and I still have the same opinion.</div>

        <div id="infoif" class="reading-info">I read this for the first time a very long time ago, prompted I think by having seen verses of it when watching Wimbledon. I find the idea of a parent giving their child advice on how to be a good person in such a beautiful way very touching.</div>
